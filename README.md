# weather-dashboard

## Notes

1. Created a geo location allow prompt...

2. Removed a geo location and tried to implement a search tool.

3. Had issues with having everything fire at once and tried to implement a 'wait' with async and having a time let everything fire in order. No Luck.

4. Submitting Weather Dashboard as is. Not functioning.  I have seeked out tutoring on Nov. 22nd to hopefully help me with this issue(s).

5. Will be resubmitting once I have working code.
